                     Hey Juniors!
                     <br><br>
                     My name is Daniel Lyalin and I am the co-presidential candidate for the DNA 
                     campaign. As a freshmen and sophomore, I’ve been active in a wide variety of 
                     leadership roles, working behind the scenes to keep many of Stuy’s clubs and 
                     extracurriculars running smoothly. You may know me as a Red Cross board member, a 
                     position from which I’ve worked to organize many of the volunteer events you’ve 
                     come to expect from New York City’s biggest Red Cross club; to that end, I’ve 
                     also accrued 60+ volunteer hours helping out around the city! As the Vice 
                     President and an active member of Ethics Forum, I’ve striven to expose Stuyvesant 
                     students to moral philosophy both through direct student outreach and through the 
                     development of Ethical Inquiries (and Where to Find Them), the clubs biannual 
                     magazine; as an active member of the club since freshmen year, I’ve seen myself 
                     grow as a person, developing a stronger moral compass and sense of direction. As 
                     a tutor for the Writing Center, I’ve aided many of my fellow juniors throughout 
                     the writing and editing process, discovering meanwhile how fulfilling tutoring 
                     can be.
                     <br><br>
                     When I’m not volunteering or drafting ethics arguments, you can find me playing 
                     tennis with the boys varsity team over at Pier 40, or watching some standup 
                     comedy on Netflix (I love John Mulaney and James Acaster). I’m also a lowkey 
                     music fan, and love to collect vinyl, especially NYC jazz rap. 
                     <br><br>
                     Having known Emmanuel Abayev since middle school, I can say with confidence that 
                     he is motivated and capable of enacting real change; his commitment to diversity 
                     and accountability, not to mention his knack for innovation, is why I choose to 
                     run with him for Junior Caucus not as President and Vice President, but as 
                     Co-Presidents -- as partners who know and trust one another. I hope that the 
                     junior class will come to know and trust us as well should we be elected.
                     <br><br>
                     Yours Truly, <br>

                     Hi Juniors!
                     <br><br>
                     I’m Emmanuel, and I’m running for Junior Caucus Co-President alongside 
                     Daniel Lyalin! Over the past two years, I have watched the Student Union 
                     and my own Freshman and Sophomore Caucuses from afar, and I can confidently 
                     say that there is room for improvement, and we are here to bring it to you!
                      <br><br>
                     Inside Stuy, I’ll often be spending my time in the Writing Center or StuyLaunch, 
                     while I’ve been spending time outside of school as a senior writer for Prep Hoops NY, 
                     working on research projects with Professors from USC and Rutgers, or spending time in 
                     an internship with Repute PR. In my free time, I like to hit the fairway, or, more 
                     realistically, sit on the couch watching some quality Netflix.
                      <br><br>
                     When I decided to run, picking a running mate was an absolute no-brainer. I have 
                     known Daniel Lyalin since middle school, and I have no doubt that his previous 
                     contribution to society, as well as his hardworking spirit would be perfect for this 
                     office. His devotion to diversity, novelty, and accountability make him perfect for 
                     Junior Caucus, and I hope you all can see the same.
                      <br><br>
                     After we all experienced four months of school-from-home, our Lyalin-Abayev 
                     ticket specializes in making the remote/blended learning experience 
                     more efficient, enjoyable, and 
                     wholesome. Our platform is built on diversity, novelty, and accountability, 
                     the core principles of any quality platform, and it’s these principles that 
                     let us guarantee a meaningful junior year to each and every junior. I strongly 
                     urge you to raise your glass to a great junior year, and to invest your vote in 
                     the Lyalin-Abayev ticket!

                  Hey everyone! I'm Joshua Gindis, one of DNA's campaign managers. I'm also a member of 
                  Stuyvesant's Model UN, write for the Spectator, 
                  and I can bake a mean baguette. I decided to support the DNA ticket because I 
                  believe a vote for DNA is a vote for change; this ticket has set lofty goals which only 
                  they can achieve, because they believe that we can always do better. 
                  <br><br>
                  Daniel and Emmanuel have proven to me time and time again their determination, 
                  expertise, and desire to do good, and I have faith that they will work hard on 
                  behalf of the junior class to make Stuyvesant a better place for everyone.
                  <br><br>

            Hey Stuy! I'm Javohir, and I am a campaign manager for the DNA ticket. I love 
            playing tennis and basketball, helping my district, researching biology, 
            and participating in various engineering programs. I am currently a part 
            of StuyMUNC and Robotics. I was a part of the SU Event Planning committee last year and 
            helped plan many of Stuy's iconic events (SING!). I was a PB Youth Fellow 
            and I helped set up a Participatory Budgeting Youth Committee in District 38.
            <br><br>
            The reason why I strongly support Daniel and Emmanuel’s ticket is that I 
            personally know them to be natural leaders dedicated to 
            bringing change. I strongly believe that their platform is the type of
            diverse and innovative planning needed in this trying time; the creativity and work ethic 
            Daniel and Emmanuel exhibit will help every Junior this coming year.
            I am certain that voting for DNA is the right decision for all the people.
            <br><br>

         Hi! I’m Corey, one of the managers of the DNA campaign. I am a current member of the 
         Science Olympiad Water Quality and Ornithology teams, as well as the Envirothon team. Outside of Stuyvesant, I am a

         the public about wildlife and conservation. I have also participated in Sing!
         <br><br>
         As both a friend and a student of this school, I wholeheartedly support Daniel and 
         Emmanuel’s plans for the school. I joined this team hoping to see their plans 
         come to life, and I believe that they are more than capable of doing so. Although this 
         school year will be very different compared to those prior, Daniel and Emmanuel 
         are dedicated to bringing the necessary changes and guidance needed to improve 
         this school and make every junior's year the very best it could be. I look forward to working with them!

         Hey juniors, I’m Michael Chan, and I'm a campaign manager for the DNA ticket. 
         In school, I’m an event leader for Science Olympiad and play second doubles on the Varsity Tennis Team; my 
         favorite subject is chemistry. In my free time, I like to play cello, play tennis, 
         and hang out with my friends. During quarantine, I’ve been 
         working on my website, Atoo.org, to inform others about the importance of voting 
         and provide quality reporting on the current political climate.
         <br><br>
         I joined the DNA campaign because I feel that they have the best interests 
         of the Stuyvesant Community at heart. I believe in this ticket not only because 
         of its unique perspective and vision for the Junior Caucus, but also because of its 
         clear dedication to helping others. I look forward to reaching out 
         and building bridges between the campaign and those we hope to serve.

                     Hello! My name is Daisy, and I’m honored to be a campaign manager for DNA. 
                     Over the course of my high school career, I’ve been an active 
                     participant in the math team, Science Olympiad, the Spectator, and Red Cross. 
                     Outside of school, I also volunteer, as I enjoy giving back to my community, 
                     including working with underperforming elementary school students. During 
                     quarantine, I even started an online prep academy, Prepasurus, with other 
                     Stuyvesant students to provide an alternative method for those looking to 
                     receive additional help in these trying times. 
                     <br><br>
                     I strongly believe in Daniel’s and Emmanuel’s ability to act as leaders in the 
                     Junior Caucus. Since my first interaction with the candidates, they have proven 
                     to be amazingly driven and passionate about their beliefs, iterating over and over
                     the need for greater transparency and diversity in the Junior Caucus. They spoke 
                     endlessly of all their ideas: everything they would enact to ensure a 
                     a supportive and productive environment for the junors here at Stuyvesant. 
                     I trust their judgment to lead the student body.

                  I'm Jason and I am one of the technology managers for DNA 2021!
                  I'm passionate about fencing and this year I'm serving as Head of Foil for the
                  Boys Varsity Stuyvesant Fencing Team. I'm also a member of the Environmental Club, 
                  and in my free time I love trying to turn "trash" into treasure!
                  <br><br>

                  Having watched COVID separate and put distance between the fencing team, 
                  I believe the Junior Caucus needs visionary leaders for the coming semester: leaders 
                  capable of enacting the kind of unique change that these unique times call for.
                  Daniel and Emmanuel have been thinking up solutions for Stuyvesant since before quarantine began,
                  dreaming of all the things they would should they be elected. In my experience with them,
                  Daniel Lyalin and Emmanuel Abayev have consistently gone above and beyond what 
                  is required of them, and I know they will work their hardest to make Stuy an even
                  better home for us all.
                  <br><br>
                  Sincerely,<br>
                  Jason Jiang

            I'm Steven and I'm a proud tech manager for DNA 2021. 
            In the future, I hope I to pursue a degree in computer science and 
            electrical engineering. Ever since I was little, I have enjoyed taking things 
            apart to find out how they work. In modern day America, everything is 
            technology based, but nobody really understands or questions how some of our tech 
            works. As a developer and tech enthusiast, I want to make it my field of study to 
            understand these little things. At Stuy, I am currently 
            in the competitive computing club and am a member of the SciOly Tech team.
            <br><br>
            As a tech manager and friend, I can wholeheartedly endorse Daniel and Emmanuel
            for the Junior Caucus Co-Presidency. Their commitment to shortening the gap 
            between us during remote learning through technology speaks to me personally,
            and I believe that they have not only the drive, but the capability, to see 
            their ideas through to the end. 
            <br><br>
            Sincerely,<br>
            Steven Rakhmanchik
