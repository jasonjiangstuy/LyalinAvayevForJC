                     Hey Juniors!
                     <br><br>
                     My name is Daniel Lyalin and I am the co-presidential candidate for the DNA 
                     campaign. As a freshmen and sophomore, I’ve been active in a wide variety of 
                     leadership roles, working behind the scenes to keep many of Stuy’s clubs and 
                     extracurriculars running smoothly. You may know me as a Red Cross board member, a 
                     position from which I’ve worked to organize many of the volunteer events you’ve 
                     come to expect from New York City’s biggest Red Cross club; to that end, I’ve 
                     also accrued 60+ volunteer hours helping out around the city! As the Vice 
                     President and an active member of Ethics Forum, I’ve striven to expose Stuyvesant 
                     students to moral philosophy both through direct student outreach and through the 
                     development of Ethical Inquiries (and Where to Find Them), the clubs biannual 
                     magazine; as an active member of the club since freshmen year, I’ve seen myself 
                     grow as a person, developing a stronger moral compass and sense of direction. As 
                     a tutor for the Writing Center, I’ve aided many of my fellow juniors throughout 
                     the writing and editing process, discovering meanwhile how fulfilling tutoring 
                     can be.
                     <br><br>
                     When I’m not volunteering or drafting ethics arguments, you can find me playing 
                     tennis with the boys varsity team over at Pier 40, or watching some standup 
                     comedy on Netflix (I love John Mulaney and James Acaster). I’m also a lowkey 
                     music fan, and love to collect vinyl, especially NYC jazz rap. 
                     <br><br>
                     Having known Emmanuel Abayev since middle school, I can say with confidence that 
                     he is motivated and capable of enacting real change; his commitment to diversity 
                     and accountability, not to mention his knack for innovation, is why I choose to 
                     run with him for Junior Caucus not as President and Vice President, but as 
                     Co-Presidents -- as partners who know and trust one another. I hope that the 
                     junior class will come to know and trust us as well should we be elected.
                     <br><br>

                     Hi Juniors!
                  <br><br>
                  <b>
                   I’m Emmanuel Abayev, and I’m running for Junior Caucus Co-President alongside Daniel Lyalin! 
                   Over the past two years, I have watched the Student Union and my own Freshman and 
                   Sophomore Caucuses from afar, and I can confidently say that there is room for 
                   improvement, and we are here to bring it to you!
                   <br><br>
                   In my free time, I’ll often be spending my time at the Writing Center or 
                   StuyLaunch, working on research projects with Professors from USC or Rutgers, or, 
                   more realistically, sitting on the couch watching some quality Netflix.
                   <br><br>
                   Armed with our experiences from last semester, our Lyalin-Abayev 
                   ticket specializes in making the remote learning experience more efficient, enjoyable, and 
                   wholesome. Our platform is built on diversity, novelty, and accountability, the 
                   core principles of any quality platform, and it’s these principles that let us 
                   guarantee a meaningful junior year to each and every junior. I strongly urge you 
                   to raise your glass to a great junior year, and to invest your vote in the
                   Lyalin-Abayev ticket!
