            <p>
              At the heart of the social contract is the belief that elected officials
              represent their voters -- that those voted into office will uphold the 
              promises they made and work to improve the lives of those they made the
              promises to. That's why the Lyalin-Abayev ticket chose Ad Populum to 
              represent itself: because we're running for, and will work to help, YOU -- the voters and the people.
